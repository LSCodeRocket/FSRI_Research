The folder Se_database19 contains:
6248 files.
3124 files named with FhtResult* are depth versus time data: 1st column shows depth, 3rd column shows physical time, the 2nd column is zero for nothing.
3124 files named with ReSurfResult* are surface profiles: 1st column show radial coordinates, 2nd column shows axial coordinates along z direction.

There is a portion silimiar to "Edot-2N1.00Y0.09", which denote parameter values for Edot, N and Y. Specifically, we have:
N=[1.0:0.1:7.0](61pts)+[1.05:0.10:1.95] (10 points),
Y/E=[0.0001:0.0001:0.0011](11pts),
edot0=[1E-5,1E-4,1E-3,1E-2](4pts).
Thus totally 71x11x4=3124

where E=9.2000e+09 for Y/E. Thus Y=[9.2e5:9.2e5:101.2e5](11pts)

The Fht and ReSurf data are one set (corresponding to the same parameter values) if their Edot--N-.--Y-.-- portion has the same values. 
Thus there are totally 3124 sets of data.

The folder CsHSO4_database20 contains:
5368 files. 
2684 files named with FhtResult* are depth versus time data: 1st column shows depth, 3rd column shows physical time, the 2nd column is zero for nothing.
2684 files named with ReSurfResult* are surface profiles: 1st column show radial coordinates, 2nd column shows axial coordinates along z direction.

There is a portion silimiar to "Edot00N1.00Y0.12", which denote parameter values for Edot, N and Y. Specifically, we have:
N=[1.0:0.1:7.0](61pts),
Y/E=[0.00001:0.00001:0.00011](11pts),
edot0=[0.1,1.0,10.0,100.0](4pts).
Thus totally 61x11x4=2684

where E=1.2000e+09 for Y/E. Thus Y=[0.12e5:0.12e5:1.32e5](11pts)

The Fht and ReSurf data are one set (corresponding to the same parameter values) if their Edot--N-.--Y-.-- portion has the same values. 
Thus there are totally 2684 sets of data.

The folder Tin_database21 contains:
5368 files. 
2684 files named with FhtResult* are depth versus time data: 1st column shows depth, 3rd column shows physical time, the 2nd column is zero for nothing.
2684 files named with ReSurfResult* are surface profiles: 1st column show radial coordinates, 2nd column shows axial coordinates along z direction.

There is a portion silimiar to "Edot00N1.00Y0.45", which denote parameter values for Edot, N and Y. Specifically, we have:
N=[1.0:0.1:7.0](61pts),
Y/E=[0.0001:0.0001:0.0011](11pts),
edot0=[0.1,1.0,10.0,100.0](4pts).
Thus totally 61x11x4=2684

where E=4.5000e+10 for Y/E. Thus Y=[0.45e7:0.45e7:4.95e7](11pts)

The Fht and ReSurf data are one set (corresponding to the same parameter values) if their Edot--N-.--Y-.-- portion has the same values. 
Thus there are totally 2684 sets of data.
